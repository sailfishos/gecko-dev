Subject: [PATCH] [sailfishos][gecko] Make fullscreen enabling work as used to
 with pref full-screen-api.content-only. Fixes JB#44129

We don't have chrome from doc shell point of view. This commit
sha1 3116f3bf53df offends fullscreen API to work without chrome
and shall not make root docShell act as chrome. We previously had
"full-screen-api.content-only" pref set to "true".
